          Streets of Rage is a series of side-scrolling beat 'em up video games,
          centering on the efforts of several ex-police vigilantes trying to rid
          a fictional, large American city from a crime syndicate that has
          corrupted its local government.

        Originally released on the Genesis in 1991, Streets of Rage was Sega's
        response to the still-burgeoning popularity of side-scrolling
        arcade-style beat-'em-ups. Capcom's Final Fight was the game to emulate
        at the time. In a lot of ways, Streets of Rage felt like little more
        than a Final Fight also-ran, right down to its three playable characters
        and comic-book-gritty urban setting.

        In Streets of Rage, you play as one of three ex-cops--Alex Hunter, Axel
        Stone, or Blaze Fielding, who are determined to clean up the apparently
        rage-filled streets of their fare city. As was the fashion of the time,
        they'll exact their brand of vigilante justice by walking to the right
        and brutalizing anyone that crosses their path. The three characters
        feel ever-so-slightly different, though the basic controls are the same,
        giving you a jump button and a single attack button, which, depending on
        the context, can be used to dish out a few different types of attack
        combos. You can also walk up to an enemy and automatically grapple them,
        and from there you can pull off moves like shoulder throws and suplexes.
        Enemies can also grapple you, though it's easy to get out of, and if you
        do end up getting thrown, a well-timed tap of the jump button will have
        you landing on your feet like some kind of bare-knuckle cat. There's
        also a cooperative angle to the grappling in the two-player game, as
        players can toss each other at enemies as a high-powered ranged attack.

        You can also call in for backup, which comes in the form of some heavy
        artillery launched by a sleek-looking police cruiser sitting several
        screens away. It's great for dealing with large crowds and especially
        obnoxious bosses, and it's one of those things that defines Streets of
        Rage. Also, accidentally calling in for backup at the very start of the
        game, assuming that the button you're pressing will produce an attack or
        a jump, is truly one of those hallmark Streets of Rage moments. The
        novelty of the police backup and the grappling business help stave off
        some of the monotony inherent to most beat-'em-ups, if at least for a
        little while. Still, for what it is, Streets of Rage is a pretty well
        made beat-'em-up. It's not a bad-looking game, with plenty of changes of
        scenery, parallax-scrolling backgrounds, and good-for-their-time
        animations, though it's hard not to be bothered by the pervasive
        pallete-swaps you'll see in the enemies you'll face. Really, the saving
        grace for Streets of Rage is the music, which is varied and catchy, and
        it makes good use of the Genesis' sound synthesizer. This was really
        some of the best music to be heard on the Genesis at its time, and the
        actual compositions stand up rather well. It's not quite as catchy or
        intricate as what would end up appearing in Streets of Rage 2, but for
        some folks, the music will be worth the price of admission here.
